This project applies a logistic regression model to classify breast cancer cases as malignant or benign using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. It demonstrates how basic machine learning techniques can be applied to medical data to support diagnostic decision-making. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to build a simple yet effective predictive model and understand the relationship between diagnostic features and cancer type.
Methodology:
* Loaded and explored the dataset from Scikit-learn
* Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature scaling
* Trained a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn
* Evaluated model performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix
Dataset: The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is available in Scikit-learn and contains 30 numerical features computed from digitized images of breast tissue. Classes: 0 – Benign, 1 – Malignant
Tools and Libraries: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Results: The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 93% in classifying breast cancer cases.
